Working at the Console", " Get up and running with R and RStudio What is R? The answer to this question very much depends on who we ask. The geeky answer is something like this… R is a dialect of the S language, which was developed by John Chambers and colleagues at Bell Laboratories in the mid 1970s. It was designed to offer an interactive computing environment for statisticians and scientists to carry out data analysis. There are essentially two widely used versions of S (though others have started to appear), a commercial one called S-Plus, and the open source implementation known as R. S-Plus came first, and although it is still around, it is used less each year. Development of R was begun in the late 1990s by two academics, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, at the University of Auckland. Their motivation was to create an open source language to enable researchers in computational statistics to explore new ideas. That language quickly evolved into something that looked more and more S-like, which we now know as R (GNU R, to be overly precise). We could go on and on about the various features that R possesses. R is a functional programming language, it supports object orientation, etc etc… but these kinds of explanations are only helpful to someone who already knows about computer languages. It is useful to understand why so many people have turned to R to meet their data analysis needs. When a typical R user talks about “R” they are often referring to two things at once, the GNU R language and the ecosystem that exists around the language: R is all about data analysis. We can carry out any standard statistical analysis in R, as well as access a huge array of more sophisticated tools with impressive names like “structural equation model”, “random forests” and “penalized regression”. These days, when statisticians and computer scientists develop a new analysis tool, they often implement it in R first. This means a competent R user can always access the latest, cutting edge analysis tools. R also has the best graphics and plotting facilities of any platform. With sufficient expertise, we can make pretty much any type of figure we need (e.g. scatter plots, phylogenetic trees, spatial maps, or even volcanoes). In short, R is a very productive environment for doing data analysis. Because R is such a good environment for data analysis, a very large community of users has grown up around it. The size of this community has increased steadily since R was created, but this growth has really increased up in the last 5-10 years or so. In the early 2000s there were very few books about R and the main way to access help online was through the widely-feared R mailing lists. Now, there are probably hundreds of books about different aspects of R, online tutorials written by enthusiasts, and many websites that exist solely to help people learn R. The resulting ecosystem is vast, and though it can be difficult to navigate at times, when we run into an R-related problem the chances are that the answer is already written down somewhere1. R is not just about data analysis—though we will mostly use it this way. It is a fully-fledged programming language, meaning that once you become moderately proficient with it you can do things such as construct numerical simulation models, solve equations, query websites, send emails, access the foaas web service, and carry out many other tasks we don’t have time to write down. We won’t do any of this year or next but it is worth noting that R can do much more than just analyse data if we need it to. Getting and installing R R is open source, meaning anyone can download the source code – the collection of computer instructions that define R – and assuming they have enough time, energy and expertise, they are free to alter it as they please. Open source does not necessarily mean free, as in it costs £0 to download and use, but luckily R is free in this sense. If you are working on the University managed desktops it should already have been installed and is ready for you to use. We encourage you to install a copy on your own laptop so that you can work at home, in the library, at a café, or wherever else you find you are productive. Do not use R on its own though. Use it in combination with the RStudio IDE discussed in the next section. In order to install R you need to download the appropriate installer from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). We are going to use the “base distribution” as this contains everything you need to use R under normal circumstances. There is a single installer for Windows. On a Mac, it’s important to match the installer to the version of OS X. In either case, R uses a the standard install mechanism that should be familiar to anyone who has installed an application on their machine. There is no need to change the default settings—doing so will probably lead to problems later on. Go ahead and install R on your own computer now. You won’t be able to make much use of this book without it. After installing R it should be visible in the Programs menu on a Windows computer or in the Applications folder on a Mac. However, it would be a good idea to read the next section before launching R… What is RStudio (and why use it)? R and RStudio are not the same thing. We can run R without RStudio if we need to, but we cannot run RStudio without R. Remember that! R is essentially just a computer program that sits there and waits for instructions in the form of text. Those instructions can be typed in by a user like you or me, or they can be sent to it from another program. This means you can run R in a variety of different environments. The job of RStudio is to provide an environment that makes R a more pleasant and productive tool. One way to get a sense of why RStudio is a Very Good Thing is to look at what running R without it is like. The simplest way to run it on a Linux or Unix-based machine (like a Mac) is to use something called the Terminal. It’s well beyond the scope of this book to get into what this is, but in a nutshell, the Terminal provides a low-level, text-based way to interact with a computer. Here is what R looks like running inside a Terminal on a Mac: We can run R in much the same way on Windows using the “Command Prompt” if we need to. The key thing you need to take away from that screenshot is that running R like this is very “bare bones”. We typed the letter “R” in the Terminal and hit Enter to start R. It printed a little information as it started up and then presented us with “the prompt” (&gt;), waiting for input. This is where we type or paste in instructions telling R what to do. There is no other way to interact with it when we run R like this – no menus or buttons, just a lonely prompt. The developers of R on Windows PCs and Macs provide a slightly nicer way to work with R. When we download and install R for either of these two operating systems, in addition to the basic R program that we just saw running in a Terminal, we also get another program that acts as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for R. This is the thing labelled “R” in the Programs menu on a Windows computer or the Applications folder on a Mac. If you launch the R GUI on your computer you will be presented with roughly the same thing on either a Windows PC or a Mac. There will be something called the Console, which is where you interact directly with R by typing things at the prompt (which looks like this: &gt;), and a few buttons and menus for managing common tasks. We will not go through these two GUIs in any more detail because we are not going to use them. We just need to know they exist so we don’t confuse them with RStudio. So what is RStudio? The first thing to note is that it is a different program from R. Remember that! RStudio is installed installed separately from R and occupies its own place in the Programs menu (Windows PC) or Applications folder (Mac). In one sense RStudio is just another Graphical User Interface for R which improves on the “bare bones” experience. However, it is a GUI on steroids. It is more accurate to describe it as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). There is no all-encompassing definition of an IDE, but they all exist to make programmer’s lives easier by integrating various useful tools into a single piece of software. From the perspective of this book, there are four key features that we care about: The R interpreter—the thing that was running in the Terminal above—runs inside RStudio. It’s accessed via a window labelled Console. This is where we type in instructions we want to execute when we are working directly with R. The Console also shows us any output that R prints in response to these instructions. So if we just want the “bare bones” experience, we can still have it. RStudio provides facilities for working with R programs using something called a Source Code Editor. An R program ( also called a “script”)&quot; is just is a collection of instructions in the R language that have been saved to a text file. Nothing more! However, it is much easier to work with a script using a proper Source Code Editor than an ordinary text editor like Notepad. An good IDE like RStudio also gives you a visual, point-and-click means of accessing various language-specific features. This is a bit difficult to explain until we have have actually used some of these, but trust us, being able to do things like manage packages, set working directories, or inspect objects we’ve made simplifies day-to-day use of R. This especially true for new users. RStudio is cross-platform—it will run on a Windows PC, a Linux PC or a Mac. In terms of the appearance and the functionality it provides, RStudio is exactly the same on each of these platforms. If we learn to work with R via RStudio on a Windows PC, it’s no problem migrating to a Mac or Linux PC later on if we need to. This is a big advantage for those of us who work on multiple platforms. We’re only going to scratch the surface of what RStudio can do and there are certainly alternative bits of software that could meet our immediate needs. The reason for introducing a powerful tool like RStudio is because one day you may need to access things like debugging facilities, package building tools, repository management. RStudio makes it easy to use these advanced tools. Getting and installing RStudio RStudio is developed and maintained by a for-profit company called… RStudio. They make their money by selling software tools and services related to R and RStudio. The basic desktop version of RStudio is free to download and use though. It can be downloaded from the RStudio download page. The one to go for is the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop, not the commercial version of RStudio Desktop. RStudio installs like any other piece of software, so there’s nothing to configure after installation. If you haven’t already done it, go ahead and install RStudio Desktop on your own computer. You are going to need it. The anatomy of RStudio Once it’s installed RStudio is run like any other stand-alone application, via the Programs menu or the Applications folder on a Windows PC or Mac, respectively2. We’ll say this one last time—RStudio only works if we’ve also installed R. Here is how RStudio appears the first time it runs: There are three panes inside a single window, which we have labelled with red numbers. Each of these has a well-defined purpose. Let’s take a quick look at these: The large window on the left is the Console. We have already told you what this is for—the Console lets you know what R is doing and provides a mechanism to interact with R by typing instructions. All this happens at the prompt, &gt;. We will be working in the Console in a moment so won’t say any more about this here. The window at the top right contains two tabs. The first of these, labelled Environment, allows us to see all the different R objects we can access. There are also some buttons that help us to get data into and out of R. The second, labelled History, allows us to see a list of instructions we’ve previously sent to R. The buttons in this tab allow us to reuse or save these instructions. The window at the bottom right contains five tabs. The first, labelled Files, gives us a way to interact with the files and folders. The next tab, labelled Plots, is where any figures we produce are displayed. This tab also allows you to save your figures to file. The Packages tab is where we view, install and update packages used to extend the functionality of R. The Help tab is where you can access and display various different help pages. The Viewer is essentially an embedded web browser for working with interactive output—we won’t be using it in this course. Don’t be alarmed if RStudio looks different on your computer. There are a couple of reasons why this might be the case. First, the appearance of RStudio is highly customisable. Take a quick look at the Tools &gt; Global Options... window to see what we mean. Second, there is a fourth window that is sometimes be visible when we work with RStudio—the source code Editor we mentioned above. RStudio saves its state between different sessions, so if we have already messed about with RStudio’s appearance or left a script open last time we used it you will see these changes. Keep in mind that RStudio is very actively developed, which means features tend to appear or change over time. Consequently, if you update it regularly expect the odd thing to change here and there. This is generally a good thing—it usually means new features have been added—but it does require you to occasionally adjust to new additions. Working at the Console R was designed to be used interactively—it is what is known as an interpreted language, which we can interact with via something called a Command Line Interface (CLI). This is just a fancy way of saying that we can type an instructions to “do something” directly into the Console and those instructions will then be interpreted when we hit the Enter key. If our R expression does not contain any errors, R will then do something like read in some data, perform a calculation, make a figure, and so on. What actually happens obviously depends on what we ask it to do. Let’s briefly see what all this means by doing something very simple with R. Type 1 + 3 at the Console and hit the Enter key: 1+3 ## [1] 4 The first line above just reminds us what we typed into the Console. The line after that beginning with ## shows us what R printed to the Console after reading and evaluating our instructions. What just happened? We can ignore the [1] bit for now (the meaning of this will become clear later in the course). What are we left with – the number 2. The instruction we gave R was in effect “evaluate the expression 1 + 3”. R read this in, decided it was a valid R expression, evaluated the expression, and then printed the result to the Console for us. Unsurprisingly, the expression 1 + 3 is a request to add the numbers 1 and 3, and so R prints the number 4 to the Console. OK, that was not very exciting. In the next chapter we will start learning to use R to carry out more useful calculations. The important take-away from this is that this sequence of events—reading instructions, evaluating those instructions and printing their output—happens every time we type or paste something into the Console and hit Enter. The printing bit is optional by the way. Whether or not it happens depends on whether you decide to capture the output or not. Just remember, if R does not print anything to the Console it does not necessarily mean nothing has happened. Why do we keep using that word expression? It has a very specific meaning in computer science. The Wikipedia page says: An expression in a programming language is a combination of explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that are interpreted according to the particular rules of precedence and of association for a particular programming language, which computes and then produces another value. That probably doesn’t make much sense, but it at least demonstrates why we don’t let computer scientists teach biologists about programming. In simple terms, an R expression is a small set of instructions written in human readable(ish) text that tell R to do something. That’s it. We could write “instructions” instead of “expressions” throughout this book but we may as well use the correct word. Whatever we call them, our aim is to learn how to combine sequences of expressions to Get Things Done in R. That’s what this book is about. The other big change is that R is finally starting to become part of the commercial landscape—learning how to use it can only improve your job prospects.↩ If you use a computer running Linux we assume you know what you are doing when it comes to installing and running software.↩ "],
["a-quick-introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 1 A quick introduction to R 1.1 Using R as a big calculator 1.2 Storing and reusing results 1.3 How does assignment work? 1.4 Global environment 1.5 Naming rules and conventions", " Chapter 1 A quick introduction to R 1.1 Using R as a big calculator 1.1.1 Basic arithmetic At the end of the last chapter we saw that R can apparently handle familiar arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. If we want to add or subtract a pair of numbers just place the + or - symbol in between two numbers, hit Enter, and R will read the expression, evaluate it, and print the result to the Console. This works exactly as we expect it to: 3 + 2 ## [1] 5 5 - 1 ## [1] 4 Multiplication and division are no different, though we don’t use x or ÷ for these operations. Instead, we use * and / to multiply and divide: 7 * 2 ## [1] 14 3 / 2 ## [1] 1.5 We can also exponentiate a numbers: raise one number to the power of another. We use the ^ operator to do this: 4^2 ## [1] 16 This raises 4 to the power of 2 (i.e. we squared it). In general, we can raise a number x to the power of y using x^y. Neither x or y need to be a whole numbers either. Arithmetic operations can also be combined into one expression. Assume we want to subtract 6 from 23. The expression to perform this calculation is: 2^3 - 6 ## [1] 2 \\(2^3=8\\) and \\(8-6=2\\). Simple enough, but what if we had wanted to carry out a slightly longer calculation that required the last answer to then be divided by 2? This is the wrong the way to do it: 2^3 - 6 / 2 ## [1] 5 The answer we were looking for is \\(1\\). So what happened? R evaluated \\(6/2\\) first and then subtracted this answer from \\(2^3\\). If that’s obvious, great. If not, it’s time to learn a bit about the order of precendence used by R. R uses a standard set of rules to decide the order in which arithmetic calculations feed into one another so that it can unambiguously evaluate any expression. It uses the same order as every other computer language, which thankfully is the same one we all learned in mathematics class at school. The order of precedence used is: exponents and roots (“taking powers”) multiplication and division additional and subtraction BODMAS and friends If you find it difficult to remember order of precedence used by R, there are a load of mnemonics that can to help. Pick one you like and remember that instead. In order to get the answer we were looking for we need to take control of the order of evaluation. We do this by enclosing grouping the necessary bits of the calculation inside parentheses (“round brackets”). That is, we place ( and ) either side of them. The order in which expressions inside different pairs of parentheses are evaluated follows the rules we all had to learn at school. The R expression we should have used is therefore: (2^3 - 6) / 2 ## [1] 1 We can use more than one pair of parentheses to control the order of evaluation in more complex calculations. For example, if we want to find the cube root of 2 (i.e. 21/3) rather than 23 in that last calculation we would instead write: (2^(1/3) - 6) / 2 ## [1] -2.370039 The parentheses around the 1/3 in the exponent are needed to ensure this is evaluated prior to being used as the exponent. 1.1.2 Problematic calculations Now is a good time to highlight how R handles certain kinds of awkward numerical calculations. One of these involves division of a number by 0. Some programming languages will respond to an attempt to do this with an error. R is a bit more forgiving: 1/0 ## [1] Inf Mathematically, division of a finite number by 0 equals A Very Large Number: infinity. R has a special built in data value that allows it to handle this kind of thing. This is Inf, which of course stands for “infinity”. The other special kind of value we sometimes run into can be generated by numerical calculations that don’t have a well-defined result. For example, it arises when we try to divide 0 or infinity by themselves: 0/0 ## [1] NaN The NaN in this result stands for Not a Number. R produces NaN because \\(0/0\\) is not defined mathematically: it produces something that is Not a Number. The reason we are pointing out Inf and NaN is not because we expect to use them. It’s important to know what they represent because they often arise as a result of a mistake somewhere in a program. It’s hard to track down such mistakes if we don’t know how Inf and NaN arise. That is enough about using R as a calculator for now. What we’ve seen—even though we haven’t said it yet—is that R functions as a REPL: a read-eval-print loop (there’s no need to remember this term). R takes user input, evaluates it, prints the results, and then waits for the next input. This is handy, because it means we can use it interactively, working through an analysis line-by-line. However, to use R to solve for complex problems we need to learn how to store and reuse results. We’ll look at this in the next section. Working efficiently at the Console Working at the Console soon gets tedious if we have to retype similar things over and over again. There is no need to do this though. Place the cursor at the prompt and hit the up arrow. What happens? This brings back the last expression sent to R’s interpreter. Hit the up arrow again to see the last-but-one expression, and so on. We go back down the list using the down arrow. Once we’re at the line we need, we use the left and right arrows to move around the expression and the delete key to remove the parts we want to change. Once an expression has been edited like this we hit Enter to send it to R again. Try it! 1.2 Storing and reusing results So far we’ve not tried to do anything remotely complicated or interesting, though we now know how to construct longer calculations using parentheses to control the order of evaluation. This approach is fine if the calculation is very simple. It quickly becomes unwieldy for dealing with anything more. The best way to see what we mean is by working through a simple example—solving a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations looks like this: \\(a + bx + cx^2 = 0\\). If we know the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) then we can solve this equation to find the values of \\(x\\) that ensure the left hand side equals the right hand side. Here’s the well-known formula for these solutions: \\[ x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\] Let’s use R to calculate these solutions for us. Say that we want to find the solutions to the quadratic equation when \\(a=1\\), \\(b=6\\) and \\(c=5\\). We just have to turn the above equation into a pair of R expressions: (-6 + (6^2 -4 * 1 * 5)^(1/2)) / (2 * 1) ## [1] -1 (-6 - (6^2 -4 * 1 * 5)^(1/2)) / (2 * 1) ## [1] -5 The output tells us that the two values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this particular quadratic equation are -1 and -5. What should we do if we now need to solve a different quadratic equation? Working at the Console, we could bring up the expressions we typed (using the up arrow) and then go through each of these, changing the numbers to match the new values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Editing individual expressions like this is fairly tedious, and more importantly, it’s fairly error prone because we have to make sure we substitute the new numbers at exactly the right positions. A partial solution to this problem is to store the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). We’ll see precisely why this is useful in a moment. First, we need to learn how to store results in R. The key to this is to use the assigment operator, written as a left arrow &lt;-. Sticking with our original example, we need to store the numbers 1, 6 and 5. We do this using three expressions, one after the another: a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- 6 c &lt;- 5 Notice that we don’t put a space between &lt; and -—R won’t like it if we try to add one. R didn’t print anything to screen, so what actually happened? We asked R to first evaluate the expression on the right hand side of each &lt;- (just a number in this case) and then assign the result of that evaluation instead of printing it. Each result has a name associated with it, which appears on the left hand side of the &lt;-. RStudio shortcut We use the assignment operator &lt;- all the time when working with R, and because it’s inefficient to have to type the &lt; and - characters over and over again, RStudio has a built in shortcut for typing the assignment operator: Alt + - . Try it. Move the curser to the Console, hold down the Alt key (‘Option’ on a Mac), and press the - sign key. RStudio will auto-magically add insert &lt;-. The net result of all this is that we have stored the numbers 1, 6 and 5 somewhere in R, associating them with the letters a, b and c, respectively. What does this mean? Here’s what happens if we type the letter a into the Console and hit Enter: a ## [1] 1 It looks the same as if we had typed the number 1 directly into the Console. The result of typing b or c is hopefully obvious. What we just did was to store the output that results from evaluating three separate R expressions, associating each a name so that we can access them again3. Whenever we use the assignment operator &lt;- we are telling R to keep whatever kind of value results from the calculation on the right hand side of &lt;-, giving it the name on the left hand side so that we can access it later. Why is this useful? Let’s imagine we want to do more than one thing with our three numbers. If we want to know their sum or their product we can now use: a + b + c ## [1] 12 a * b * c ## [1] 30 So once we’ve stored a result and associated it with a name we can reuse it wherever it’s needed. Returning to our motivating example, we can now calculate the solutions to the quadratic equation by typing these two expressions into the Console: (-b + (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2)) / (2 * a) ## [1] -1 (-b - (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2)) / (2 * a) ## [1] -5 Imagine we’d like to find the solutions to a different quadratic equation where \\(a=1\\), \\(b=5\\) and \\(c=5\\). We just changed the value of \\(b\\) here to keep things simple. To find our new solutions we have to do two things. First we change the value of the number associated with b… b &lt;- 5 …then we bring up those lines that calculate the solutions to the quadratic equation and run them, one after the other: (-b + (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2)) / (2 * a) ## [1] -1.381966 (-b - (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2)) / (2 * a) ## [1] -3.618034 We didn’t have to retype those two expressions. We could just use the up arrow to bring each one back to the prompt and hit Enter. This is much simpler than editing the expressions. More importantly, we are beginning to see the benefits of using something like R: we can break down complex calculations into a series of steps, storing and reusing intermediate results as required. 1.3 How does assignment work? It’s important to understand, at least roughly, how assignment works. The first thing to note is that when we use the assignment operator &lt;- to associate names and values, we informally refer to this as creating (or modifying) a variable. This is much less tedious than using words like “bind”, “associate”, value“, and”name&quot; all the time. Why is it called a variable? What happens when we run these lines: myvar &lt;- 1 myvar &lt;- 7 The first time we used &lt;- with myvar on the left hand side we created a variable myvar associated with the value 1. The second line myvar &lt;- 7 modified the value of myvar to be 7. This is why we refer to myvar as a variable: we can change the its value as we please. What happened to the old value associated with myvar? In short, it is gone, kaput, lost… forever. The moment we assign a new value to myvar the old one is destroyed and can no longer be accessed. Remember this. Keep in mind that the expression on the right hand side of &lt;- can be any kind of calculation, not just just a number. For example, if I want to store the number 1, associating it with answer, I could do this: answer &lt;- (1 + 2^3) / (2 + 7) That is a strange way to assign the number 1, but it illustrates the point. More generally, as along as the expression on the right hand side generates an output it can be used with the assignment operator. For example, we can create new variables from old variables: newvar &lt;- 2 * answer What happened here? Start at the right hand side of &lt;-. The expression on this side contained the variable answer so R went to see if answer actually exists in the global environment. It does, so it then substituted the value associated with answer into the requested calculation, and then assigned the resulting value of 2 to newvar. We created a new variable newvar using information associated with answer. Now look at what happens if we just copy a variable using the assignment operator: myvar &lt;- 7 mycopy &lt;- myvar At this point we have two variables, myvar and mycopy, each associated with the number 7. There is something very important going on here: each of these is associated with a different copy of this number. If we change the value associated with one of these variables it does not change the value of the other, as this shows: myvar &lt;- 10 myvar ## [1] 10 mycopy ## [1] 7 R always behaves like this unless we work hard to alter this behaviour (we never do this in this book). So remember, every time we assign one variable to another, we actually make a completely new, independent copy of its associated value. For our purposes this is a good thing because it makes it much easier to understand what a long sequence of R expressions will do. That probably doesn’t seem like an obvious or important point, but trust us, it is. 1.4 Global environment Whenever we associate a name with a value we create a copy of both these things somewhere in the computer’s memory. In R the “somewhere” is called an environment. We aren’t going to get into a discussion of R’s many different kinds of environments—that’s an advanced topic well beyond the scope of this book. The one environment we do need to be aware of though is the Global Environment. Whenever we perform an assignment in the Console the name-value pair we create (i.e. the variable) is placed into the Global Environment. The current set of variables are all listed in the Environment tab in RStudio. Take a look. Assuming that at least one variable has been made, there will be two columns in the Environment tab. The first shows us the names of all the variables, while the second summarises their values. The Global Environment is temporary By default, R will save the Global Environment whenever we close it down and then restore it in the next R session. It does this by writing a copy of the Global Environment to disk. In theory this means we can close down R, reopen it, and pick things up from where we left off. Don’t do this—it only increases the risk of making a serious mistake. Assume that when R and RStudio are shut down, everything in Global Environment will be lost. 1.5 Naming rules and conventions We don’t have to use a single letter to name things in R. The words tom, dick and harry could be used in place of a, b and c. It might be confusing to use them, but tom, dick and harry are all legal names as far as to R is concerned: A legal name in R is any sequence of letters, numbers, ., or _, but the sequence of characters we use must begin with a letter. Both upper and lower case letters are allowed. For example, num_1, num.1, num1, NUM1, myNum1 are all legal names, but 1num and _num1 are not because they begin with 1 and _. R is case sensitive—it treats upper and lower case letters as different characters. This means that num and Num are treated as distinct names. Forgetting about case sensitivity is a good way to create errors when using R. Try to remember that. Don’t begin a name with . We are allowed to begin a name with a ., but this usually is A Bad Idea. Why? Because variable names that begin with . are hidden from view in the Global Environment—the value it refers to exists but it’s invisible. This behaviour exists to allow R to create invisible variables that control how it behaves. This is useful, but it isn’t really meant to be used by the average user. Technically, this is called binding the name to a value. You really don’t need to remember this though.↩ "],
["scripts.html", "Chapter 2 Building scripts 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Writing scripts in RStudio 2.3 Running scripts in RStudio 2.4 Spotting problems", " Chapter 2 Building scripts 2.1 Introduction We have seen that using variables is useful because it enables us to break down a problem into a series of simpler steps. So far however, we have only been working in the Console. If we want to reuse a calculation when we’re working like this, we have to change a variable or two and then evaluate the expressions that do the job of solving an equation, make a graph, whatever. We also have to do all of this in the correct order, or things will not work as intended. Working directly at the Console like this is the simplest way to use R. Generally speaking, we do not recommend working this way unless you only need to do something very simple which involves a handful of steps. For more complicated activities you should store your instructions in a script. We will look at how to do this at the end of this chapter. The aim of this section is to demonstrate how to use R to perform simple calculations and introduce a few key concepts that will help you understand how R works. At this stage – for the purposes of learning how to use R – typing expressions directly into the Console is fine. You can see that working in the Console is not going to be practical most of the time. So what should we do? The answer is: put your sequence of R expressions into a text file, called a script (We already told you the answer earlier). Calling it a script makes it sound a bit fancy and clever—“I spent all day debugging my script”. It is not. It is a boring text file that could be opend up in something like Notepad.exe. We just call it a script to signify the fact that the text contained in the file is a series of instructions telling our computer to do something. 2.2 Writing scripts in RStudio To open a new script in RStudio navigate to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. This will open the new file in a fourth pane. This pane is the Source Code Editor we mentioned in the Get up and running with R and RStudio chapter. The name of the tab where this new file lives will be set to Untitled1 if you haven’t opened any other new R Scripts. Here is what RStudio looks like after we do this (we’ve highlighted the new pane with a red asterisk): When you work with a script you type the required sequence of R expressions into the Editor pane, not directly into the Console. This is important—if you mix and match you will make mistakes. The worst of these is that you will write a script that seems to work, only to find it is broken when you open it up and use it again later. This usually happens because you typed something into the Console that is needed to make the whole script run when you were preparing it, but then forget to put it into the script. Just don’t mix and match between using the Console and the Editor and you will avoid this. The easiest way to appreciate the benefits of using a script is to work with one. If you have not already done so, open up a new script using File &gt; New File &gt; R Script and copy-paste this into the Editor pane: a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- 6 c &lt;- 5 sqrt.b2ac &lt;- (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2) (-b + sqrt.b2ac) / (2 * a) (-b - sqrt.b2ac) / (2 * a) Here is a partial screenshot of the Editor pane showing this script on our computer: MISSING SENTENCE. Syntax highlighting is a must have feature of any Editor. In a nutshell, syntax is a bit like the grammar of a computer language. It is the set of rules that determine how we form valid expressions, assign variables, and so on. The purpose of syntax highlighting is to draw attention to different components of syntax. You can see that when we use the Cobalt highlighting option, RStudio sets the background to black and displays variables in white, parentheses and arithmetic operators in orange, and numbers in red. It doesn’t matter so much what the colours are. What matters is that we have a visual means to distinguish these different kinds of elements, making it much easier to read a script. Choose your own colour scheme The first thing you will probably notice is that this Editor looks a little different from yours. We said earlier that RStudio was highly customisable. What we did above was change the way it does something called syntax highlighting. You can do this by navigating to Tools &gt; Global Options…, selecting the Appearance button, and picking the Cobalt option under Editor theme (try it!). The other kind of elements RStudio has highlighted are in blue. We added these. They are called comments. Comments in R always start with a # symbol—this is called the “hash”&quot; symbol if you are British (or the “pound” symbol if you are North American). Lines that start with # are completely ignored by R. They exist only to allow us, the developers of a script, to add notes and explanations that remind us how it all works. Comments are important At this point we just want to emphasise that you should use comments to remind yourself what your R code is supposed to be doing. Use them liberally to help you understand the logic of each script you write. This is another “take our word”&quot; for it situation – if you do not use comments, then when you come back to your precious script in a few weeks/months/years time you will have no idea what it does. 2.3 Running scripts in RStudio The whole point of writing a script is ultimatley to run it. The phrase “run our code” is shorthand for “send a number of R expressions to the R interpreter to be read and evaluated”. The latter is tedious to write (and read) over and over again, so we will just write “run your/my/our code”. We could run the code in the above script by copying and pasting it into the Console, but this is inefficient. Instead of relying on cut and paste, RStudio gives us different ways to run our code: There is a Run button at the top right of the Editor pane. As you might imagine, clicking on this will run some code. If you haven’t highlighted anything in the Editor, this runs whichever line the cursor is at, i.e. it runs just that one line. If you had highlighted a region inside the Editor, this button will run all of that in sequence. We do not like clicking buttons. If you are like us, you are in luck. Pressing Control+Enter (or Command+Enter on a Mac) does exactly the same thing as the Run button. It also uses the same rules to decide which bits of code to run or not4. Using which ever method you prefer, run every line in the script you just started. Here is what should happen at the Console when you do this: a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- 6 c &lt;- 5 sqrt.b2ac &lt;- (b^2 -4 * a * c)^(1/2) (-b + sqrt.b2ac) / (2 * a) ## [1] -1 (-b - sqrt.b2ac) / (2 * a) ## [1] -5 This works exactly as though you had typed or pasted the sequence of R expressions into the Console, hitting Enter each time you get to the end of a line. What this means is that we can use this script to find the solutions to any quadratic equation with real roots (if you know what we mean by the phrase “real roots”, great, if not, it does not really matter). All you have to do is edit the values assigned to a, b and c and then rerun the whole script. Do not rerun bits of it. Rerun it all. Try it. Just be sure to only use sets of values where \\(b^2 &gt; 4ac\\) or you will see the dreaded NaN. Now that we have a script that does something a little useful we might wish to use it again. It is just a text file, so we can save the script as we would any other file. We can do this using the familiar menu-based approach (File &gt; Save As...) or via the keyboard shortcut Control+S (or Command+S on a Mac). The only thing to keep in mind is that you should use the file extension .R or .r, e.g. my_great_script.R. This is because RStudio uses the file extension to detect the fact that a file is a script and not an ordinary text file. If you do not do this, then next time you open up the file in RStudio you won’t be able to access the fancy Editor features like syntax highlighting, nor will you be able to send lines to the Console without using copy-paste. From now on you should always work with scripts. No more typing into the Console! 2.4 Spotting problems We may as well get something out of the way early on: you will ask R to do something that turns out to contain an error. Mistakes happen all the time when You will do this a lot. It’s not a problem when this happens. When it does though, it’s important to step back and work out what went wrong. 2.4.1 The dreaded + Be careful when you highlight code to run. RStudio will run exactly the text you highlight. If you start or finish the highlighted region in the middle of an expression then one of three things will usually happen. If you are lucky you will generate an error, since you end up running only part an expression that is not itself a valid expression. We say this is lucky because the error will at least be easy to spot. If you are unlucky, you might end up running part an expression that is itself a valid expression. This is harder to spot because it won’t generate an error, and it will probably create problems further down the line. The third outcome is that your Console will look something like this (ignore the colours – we am still using that Cobalt theme): What happened? Look carefully at the little snippet of R code we sent to the Console. It is not a complete R expression because it is missing a closing parenthesis, ). When R receives only part of an expression like this, which has correct syntax but is not complete, it sits and waits for the rest of the expression. This is what the + at the Console signifies. When you see this happen you have two options. You can manually type in the missing part of the expression and hit Enter, or you can hit the Escape key to return you to the prompt &gt; and start again. The first option is very error prone, so we would generally do the latter. 2.4.2 Errors Here is an example of what happens at the Console when you generate an error: xyz + 2 ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;xyz&#39; not found In general terms, what happened is that R read in the instruction xyz + 2, tried to evaluate it, and found it could not. This is because the variable xyz does not exist. Upon running into the error, R printed something to the screen to tell us we have made a mistake (“Error: object ‘xyz’ not found”). When this happens we say R has “thrown an error”. We know this because the message is in a warning colour (prbably red or orange—it depends how RStudio is set up) and it contains the word Error. The bit after the : is an attempt by R to tell me what went wrong. You should always read your error messages. They will be incomprehensible at first, but as you fix the many mistakes you will inevitably make, they will start to make more sense and become helpful (usually—sometimes they make no sense whatsoever, even to experienced users). This way of learning only works if you read the error messages in the first place though. We can also run lines of code via the Code &gt; Run Lines. This is easily the most inefficient method after cut and paste. It’s only there in case we forget our keyboard shortcut or cannot remember where the run button is.↩ "],
["using-functions.html", "Chapter 3 Using functions 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Evaluating arguments and returning results 3.3 Functions do not have “side effects” 3.4 Combining functions 3.5 Specifying function arguments", " Chapter 3 Using functions 3.1 Introduction Functions are a basic building block of any programming language. If you want to use R effectively—even if your needs are very simple—you need to understand how to use functions. We are not aiming to unpick the inner workings of functions in this course. That is an advanced topic that is best saved for a future time when you have gained much more experience of using them5. The aim of this chapter is to explain what functions are for, how to use them, and how to avoid mistakes when doing so. The job of each function in R is to carry out some kind of calculation or computation that would typically require many lines of R code to do “from scratch”. Functions allow us to reuse common computations while offering some control over the precise details of what actually happens. The best way to see what we mean by this is to see one in action. The round function is used to round one or more number(s) to a significant number of digits. To use it, we could type this into the Console and hit Enter: round(x = 3.141593, digits = 2) We have suppressed the output for now so that we can unpack things a bit first. Every time we use a function we always have to work with the same basic construct (there are a few exceptions, but we can ignore these for now). We start with the name of the function, that is, we use the name of the function as the prefix. In this case, the function name is round. After the function name, we need a pair of opening and closing parentheses. It is this combination of name and parentheses that that alerts R to fact that we are trying to use a function. Whenever you see name followed by opening and closing parentheses you are seeing a function in action. What about the bits inside the parentheses? These are called the arguments of the function. That is a horrible name, but it is the one that everyone uses so you will have to get used to it. Depending on how it was defined, a function can take zero, one, or more arguments. We will discuss this idea in more detail later in this section. In the simple example above, we used the round function with two arguments. Each of these was supplied as a name-value pair, separated by a comma. When working with arguments, name-value pairs occur either side of the equals (=) sign, with the name of the argument on the left hand side and the value it takes on the right hand side (notice that the syntax highlighter we used to make this website helpfully colours the argument names differently from the values). The name serves to identify which argument we are working with, and the value is the thing that controls what that argument does in the function. We refer to the process of associating argument names and values as “supplying the arguments” of the function (sometimes we also say “setting the arguments”). Notice the similarly between supplying function arguments and the assignment operation discussed in the last topic. The difference here is that name-value pairs are associated with the = symbol. This association is also temporary: it only lasts as long as it takes for the function to do whatever it does. Use = to assign arguments Do not use the assignment operator &lt;- inside the parentheses when working with functions. This is a “trust us” situation: you will end up in all kinds of difficulty if you do this. The names of the arguments that we are allowed to use are typically determined for us by the function. That is, we are not free to choose whatever name we like. We say “typically”, because R is a very flexible language and so there are certain exceptions to this simple rule of thumb. For now it is simpler to think of the names as pre-determined by whatever function you are using though. The arguments control the behaviour of a function. Our job as users is to set the values of the these to get the behaviour we want. By now it is now probably fairly obvious what is going to happen when we used the round function like this at the Console: round(x = 3.141593, digits = 2) ## [1] 3.14 Remember, we said the round function rounds one or more numbers to a number of significant digits. The argument that specifies the focal number(s) is x; the second argument, digits, specifies the number of decimal places we require. Based on the supplied values of these arguments, 3.141593 and 2, respectively, the round function spits out a value of 3.14, which is then printed to the Console. If we had wanted to the answer to 3 significant digits we would use digits = 3. This is what we mean when we say the values of the supplied arguments controls the behaviour of the function. 3.2 Evaluating arguments and returning results Whenever R evaluates a function we refer to this action as “calling the function”. In our simple example, we called the round function with arguments x and digits (in this course we treat the phrases “use the function” and “call the function” as synonyms, as the former is more natural to new users). What we have just seen—though you may not realise it yet—is that when we call functions they first evaluate their arguments, then perform some kind of action, and finally (optionally) return a value to us when they finish doing whatever it is they do We will discuss that word “return” in a moment. What do we mean by the word “evaluate” in this context? Take a look at this second example which uses round again: round(x = 2.3 + 1.4, digits = 0) ## [1] 4 When you call a function, what typically happens is that everything on the right hand side of an = is first evaluated, the result of this evaluation becomes associated with the corresponding argument name, and then the function does its calculations using the resulting name-value pairs. We say “typically” because other kinds of behaviours are possible—remember, R is a very flexible language—though for the purposes of this course we can assume that what we just wrote is always true. What happened above is that R evaluated 2.3 + 1.4, resulting in the number 3.7, which was then associated with the argument x. We set digits to 0 this time so that round just returns a whole number, 4. The important thing to realise is that the expression(s) on the right hand side of the = can be anything you like. This third example essentially equivalent to the last one: myvar &lt;- 2.3 + 1.4 round(x = myvar, digits = 0) ## [1] 4 This time we created a new variable called myvar and then supplied this as the value of the x argument. When we call the round function like this, the R interpreter spots the fact that something on the right hand side of an = is a variable and associates the value of this variable with x argument. As long as we have actually defined the numeric variable myvar at some point we can use it as the value of an argument. Keeping in mind what you have just learned, take a careful look at this example: x &lt;- 0 round(x = 3.7, digits = x) ## [1] 4 What is going on here? The key to understanding this is to realise that the symbol x is used in two different ways here. When it appears on the left hand side of the = it represents an argument name. When it appears on the right hand side it is treated as a variable name, which must have a value associated with it for the above to be valid. This is admittedly a slightly confusing way to use this function, but it is perfectly valid. The message here is that what matters is where things appear relative to the =, not the symbols used to represent them. We said at the beginning of this section that a function may optionally return a value to us when they finish complete their task. That word “return” is just jargon that refers to the process by which a function outputs a value. If you use a function at the Console this will be the value printed at the end. We can use this value in other ways too. For example, there is nothing to stop you combining function calls with the arithmetic operations: 2 * round(x = 2.64, digits = 0) ## [1] 6 Here the The R interpreter first evaluates the function call, and then multiplies the value it returns by 2. As you would expect, if we want to reuse this value we have to assign the result of function call, for example: roundnum &lt;- 2 * round(x = 2.64, digits = 0) Using a function with &lt;- is really no different from the examples using multiple arithmetic operations in the last topic. The R interpreter starts on the right hand side of the &lt;-, evaluates the function call there, and only then assigns the value to roundnum. 3.3 Functions do not have “side effects” There is one more idea about functions and their arguments that you really need to understand in order to avoid confusing yourself later on in this course. It relates to how functions modify their arguments, or more accurately, how they do not modify their arguments. Take a look at this example: myvar &lt;- 3.7 round(x = myvar, digits = 0) ## [1] 4 myvar ## [1] 3.7 We created a variable myvar with the value 3.7, rounded this to a whole number with round, and then printed the value of myvar. Notice that the value of myvar has not changed after using it as an argument to round. This is important. R functions typically do not alter the values of their arguments. Again, we say “typically” because there are ways to alter this behaviour if we really want to (yes, R is a very flexible language), but we will never ever do this. The standard behaviour—that functions do not alter their arguments—is what is meant by the phrase “functions do not have side effects”. If we had meant to round the value of myvar so that we can use this new value later on, we have to assign the result of function evaluation, like this: myvar &lt;- 3.7 myvar &lt;- round(x = myvar, digits = 0) In this example, we just overwrote the old value, but we could just as easily have created a new variable. The reason this is worth pointing out is that new users sometimes assume certain types of functions will alter their arguments. Specifically, when working with functions manipulate something called a data.frame, there is a tendency to assume that the function changes the data.frame argument. It will not. If you want to make use of the changes, rather than just see them printed to the Console, you need to assign the results. You can do this by creating a new variable or overwriting the old one. You will gain first hand experience of this in the Data Wrangling block. Remember, functions do not have side effects! Some of you will forget this and it will create all kinds of headaches. Don’t be that person. 3.4 Combining functions Up until now we have not tried to do anything very complicated in our examples. Using R to actually get useful work almost always involves multiple steps, very often facilitated a number of different functions. There is more than one way to do this. Here is a simple example that takes an approach you should already understand: myvar &lt;- sqrt(x = 10) round(x = myvar, digits = 0) ## [1] 3 Hopefully you can see what happened here. We calculated the square root of the number 10 and assigned the result to myvar, then we rounded this to a whole number and printed the result to the Console. So one way to use a series of functions in sequence is to assign a name to the result at each step and use this as an argument to the function in the next step. Here is another way to replicate the calculation in the previous example: round(x = sqrt(x = 10), digits = 0) ## [1] 3 The technical name for this is function composition (you might recognise that phrase from secondary school mathematics). Another way of referring to this kind of expression is as a nested function call: we say that the sqrt function is nested inside the round function. The way you should read these constructs is from the inside out. The sqrt(x = 10) expression is on the right hand side of an = symbol, so this is evaluated first, the result is associated with the x argument of the round function, and only then does the round function do its job. There aren’t really any new ideas here. We have already seen that the R interpreter evaluates whatever is on the right hand side of the = symbol first before associating the resulting value with the appropriate argument name. However, new users are often confused by nested function calls, so we want you to see them in action. There is nothing to stop us using multiple levels of nesting either. Take a look at this example: round(x = sqrt(x = abs(x = -10)), digits = 0) ## [1] 3 The abs function takes the absolute value of a number, i.e. removes the - sign if it is there. Remember, read nested calls from the inside out. In this example, first we took the absolute value of -10, then we took the square root of the resulting number (10), and then we rounded this to a whole number. Nested function calls are useful because they make our R code less verbose (we have to write less), but this comes at the cost of reduced readability. Experienced users are used to nesting so they don’t mind it, but we leave it to you to decide whether to use it much. Though we aim to keep function nesting to a minimum in this course, you will occasionally have to work with the nesting construct so you should try to understand it even if you don’t like using it. We will also see a much-easier-to-read method for applying a series of functions in the Data Wrangling block. 3.5 Specifying function arguments We have only been working with functions that carry out mathematical calculations with numbers so far. We will see many more in this course as it unfolds. Some functions are designed to extract information about functions for us. For example, take a look at the args function: args(name = round) ## function (x, digits = 0) ## NULL You might be able to see what args does: it prints a summary of the main arguments of a function to the Console (it doesn’t always print all the available arguments though). What can we learn from the summary of the round arguments? Notice that the first argument, x, is shown without an associated value, whereas the digits part of the summary is printed as digits = 0. The significance of this is that digits has a default value. This means that we can leave out digits when using the round function: round(x = 3.7) ## [1] 4 This is obviously the same result as we would get using round(x = 3.7, digits = 0). This is a very useful feature of R, as it allows us keep our R code concise. Some functions take a large number of arguments, many of which are defined with sensible defaults. Unless we need to change these default arguments, we can just ignore them when we call such functions. The x argument of round does not have a default, which means we have to supply a value. This is sensible, as the whole purpose of round is to round any number we give it. There is another way to simplify our use of functions. Take a look at this example: round(3.72, digits = 1) ## [1] 3.7 What does this demonstrate? We do not have to specify argument names, i.e. there is no need to specify argument names. In the absence of an argument name the R interpreter uses the position of the supplied argument to work out which name to associate it with. In this example we left out the name of the argument at position 1. This is where x belongs, so we end up rounding 3.71 to 1 decimal place. R is even more flexible than this, as it carries out partial matching on argument names: round(3.72, dig = 1) ## [1] 3.7 This also works because R can unambiguously match the argument I named dig to digits. Take note, if there were another argument to round that started with the letters dig this would have caused an error. You need to know your function arguments if you want to rely of partial matching. Be careful with your arguments Here is some advice. Do not rely on partial matching of function names. It just leads to confusion and the odd error. If you use it a lot you end up forgetting the true name of arguments, and if you abbreviate too much you create name matching conflicts. For example, if a function has arguments arg1 and arg2 and you use the partial name a for an argument, there is no way to know which argument you meant. We are pointing out partial matching so that you are aware of the behaviour. It is not worth the hassle of getting it wrong just to save on a little typing, so do not use it. What about position matching? This can also cause problems if we’re not paying attention. For example, if you forget the order of the arguments to a function and then place your arguments in the wrong place, you will either generate an error or produce a nonsensical result. It is nice not to have to type out the name = value construct all the time though, so our advice is to rely positional matching only for the first argument. This is a common convention in R, and it makes sense because it is often obvious what kind of information or data the first argument should carry, so the its name is redundant. At some point, if you really want to understand what happens when you use a function you will need to grapple with ideas like lazy evaluation, environments and scoping.↩ "],
["numeric-vectors.html", "Chapter 4 Numeric vectors 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Numeric vectors 4.3 Making numeric vectors 4.4 Vectorised operations 4.5 Extracting subsets of vectors", " Chapter 4 Numeric vectors 4.1 Introduction [FIXME] Remember that we said atomic vectors are the simplest kind of data structure in R? This really is true, in that whenever you work with a number in R you are (invisibly) working with a atomic (numeric) vector of length one. Here is the very first R expression we evaluate in the last topic: 1+1 ## [1] 2 Look at the output. It has is [1] at the beginning. We told you to ignore this before because we weren’t in a position to understand its significance. Now we are. It is a clue that the output resulting from 1+1 is in fact an numeric vector. If you need more convincing try using the is.atomic and is.numeric functions. These check whether their argument is atomic and numeric, respectively: both is.atomic(1+1) and is.numeric(1+1) print TRUE to the screen. This little exercise demonstrates an important point about R, which is that unlike many other languages, there is no way to represent just a number. A single number is treated as a vector of length one. The same is true for things like character strings and logical values discussed below. 4.2 Numeric vectors The most common type of atomic vector we tend to work with in R are numeric vectors. In this section we will see how to make numeric vectors. We will also learn “vectorised operations”, using numeric vectors to illustrate the main ideas. Keep in mind that these also apply to other kinds of vectors. Here is one of the simplest ways to make a numeric vector: numeric(length = 50) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [36] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 What happened here? We made a numeric vector with 50 elements, each of which is the number 0. When we create a vector but don’t assign it to a name using &lt;- R just prints it to the Console for us, as you should expect by now. The word “element” is used to reference any object (a number in this case) that resides at a particular position. Notice what happens when the numeric vector is printed to the screen. It can’t fit on one line, so it is printed over two. At the beginning of each line there is a [X], where the X is a number that describes the position of the element at the beginning of that line. Different kinds of numbers Roughly speaking, R stores numbers in two different ways depending of whether they are whole numbers (“integers”) or numbers containing decimal points (“doubles” – don’t ask). We are not going to worry about this distinction. Generally speaking, the distinction is invisible to us as users so it is easier to just think in terms of numeric vectors. If we need to check that we really have made a numeric vector there is a function called is.numeric to do this: numvec &lt;- numeric(length = 50) is.numeric(numvec) ## [1] TRUE This returns TRUE as expected (a value of FALSE would imply that numvec is some other kind of object). This probably doesn’t look like the most useful function in the world, but sometimes we need simple sanity checks to root out mistakes in our scripts. One thing to keep in mind is that when you print a numeric vector to Console R only prints the elements to 7 significant figures by default. We can see this by printing the built in constant pi to the Console: pi ## [1] 3.141593 The actual value stored in pi is much more precise than this. 4.3 Making numeric vectors We just learned how to use the numeric function to make a numeric vector of zeros of any length (just vary the the length argument). This is arguably not a particularly useful skill. Usually, we want to work with a vector whose elements have particular values. One of the more useful functions for creating these is the c function, where the “c” stands for combine. Take a look at this example: c(1.1, 2.3, 4.0, 5.7) ## [1] 1.1 2.3 4.0 5.7 The c function takes a variable number of arguments, each of which is a vector. In this example we supplied the c function with four arguments, each of which was a vector of length 1 (remember: a single number is treated as a length-one vector). The c function combines these to generate a vector of length 4. Simple. Now look at this example: vec1 &lt;- c(1.1, 2.3) vec2 &lt;- c(4.0, 5.7) c(vec1, vec2) ## [1] 1.1 2.3 4.0 5.7 This just shows that we can use the c function to concatenate (“stick together”) two or more vectors, even if they are not of length 1. You may have noticed that we did not name the arguments in those two examples (there was no = involved). The c function is an example of one of those flexible functions that breaks the simple rules of thumb for using arguments that we set out earlier: it can take a variable number of arguments that do not have predefined names. This behaviour is necessary if you think about how c has to work. In order to be at all useful it needs to be able to take any combination of arguments. We can name the arguments if we want to, resulting in a named vector. We will look at the effect of using named arguments with c and named vectors in general in the next section. The main limitation of the c function is that we have to manually construct vectors from their elements. This is not very practical if we need to construct long vectors of numeric values. This is a very common task in R. There are a couple of functions worth knowing about to help us do this. These are useful when the elements of the target vector need to follow a sequence or repeating pattern. Again, these kinds of vectors are used a lot in R. Finding out about a vector R Sometimes it is useful to be able to find out a little extra information about a vector you are working with, especially if it is very large. Three functions that can extract some useful information about a vector for us are length, head and tail. Using a variety of different vectors, experiment with these to find out what they do. Make sure you use vectors that aren’t too short (e.g. with a length of at least 10). Hint: head and tail can be used with a second argument, n. 4.3.1 Named vectors What happens if we name the arguments to c when constructing a vector? Take a look at this: namedv &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) namedv ## a b c ## 1 2 3 What happened here is that the argument names were used to define the names of elements in the vector we made. The resulting vector is still a 1-dimensional data structure. When it is printed to the Console the value of each element is printed, along with the associated name above it. We can extract the names from a named vector using the names function: names(namedv) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; Being able to name the elements of a vector is very useful because it enables us to more easily identify relevant information and extract the bits we need—we’ll see how this works in the next chapter. 4.3.2 Generating sequences of numbers The seq function is (unsurprisingly) designed to generate sequences of numbers. We always have to specify at least two arguments, from and to. These specify the start and end values of the sequence we are aiming for, respectively. There are different ways to control the sequence produced by seq. The method is determined by our choice of arguments: by, length.out and along.with. You typically need to specify three out of the five main arguments of seq, although fewer can be used. Using the by argument generates a sequence of numbers that increase or decrease by the requested step size: seq(from = 0, to = 12, by = 2) ## [1] 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 This is fairly self-explanatory. The seq function constructed a numeric vector with elements that started at 0 and ended 12, with successive elements increasing in steps of 2. Be careful when using seq like this. If the by argument does not lead to a sequence that ends exactly on the value of to then that value won’t appear in the vector. For example: seq(from = 0, to = 11, by = 2) ## [1] 0 2 4 6 8 10 You can generate a descending sequence by using a negative by value, like this: seq(from = 12, to = 0, by = -2) ## [1] 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Just remember to make sure the from argument is larger than the by argument if you do this or you will generate an error. Using the length.out argument generates a sequence of numbers such that the resulting vector has the length specified by length.out: seq(from = 0, to = 12, length = 6) ## [1] 0.0 2.4 4.8 7.2 9.6 12.0 Using the length.out argument will always produce a sequence that starts and ends exactly on the values specified by from and to. Obviously, if you need a descending sequence just make sure from is larger than to. Using the along.with argument allows us to use another vector to determine the length of the numeric sequence we want to produce: myvec &lt;- c(1, 3, 7, 2, 4, 2) seq(from = 0, to = 12, along.with = myvec) ## [1] 0.0 2.4 4.8 7.2 9.6 12.0 It does not matter what the elements of myvec were in this example. It is the length of myvec that controls the behaviour of seq when we use the along.with. This example generated the same result as the last one because the length of myvec is 6. When using the seq function it is conventional to leave out the from and to argument names. It is obvious what behaviour is controlled by these first two arguments, so we tend not to name them to keep our R code compact. For example, we would typically write the first example in this subsection as: seq(0, 12, by = 2) ## [1] 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 If you leave out the name of the third argument as well, position matching or arguments ensures that it is treated as the by argument. This is equivalent to the previous example: seq(0, 12, 2) ## [1] 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Our advice is to explicitly name the by argument for now, rather than relying on position matching. this will remind you what you are doing and will hopefully stop you forgetting about the different control arguments. If we do not specify values of either by, length.out and along.with when using seq the default behaviour is to assume we meant by = 1: seq(from = 0, to = 12) ## [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Generating sequences of integers that go up or down in steps of 1 is something we frequently have to do in R. Because of this, there is a special operator to help us do this – the colon, :. It is very straightforward to understand. For example, to produce the last sequence again we use: 1:12 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 When we use the : operator the convention is to not leave spaces either side of it. 4.3.3 Generating repeated sequences of numbers The rep function is designed to replicate the values inside a vector (no surprises there). The rep function is easy to use. The first argument (called x) is the vector we want to replicate. There are two other arguments that control how this is done. The times argument just specifies the number of times to replicate the whole vector: seqvec &lt;- 1:4 rep(seqvec, times = 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 All we did here was take a sequence of integers from 1 to 4 and replicate this end-to-end, three times. The resulting vector has length 12. Alternatively, we use the each argument to first replicate each element of a vector, then combine these end-to-end: seqvec &lt;- 1:4 rep(seqvec, each = 3) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 This example produced a similar vector to the previous one. It contains the same elements and has the same length, but now the order is different. All the 1’s appear first, then the 2’s, and so on. We can also use both the times and each arguments together if we want to: seqvec &lt;- 1:4 rep(seqvec, times = 3, each = 2) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 The way to think about how this works is to imagine that you apply rep twice, first with each = 2, then with times = 3 (or vice versa). We can achieve the same thing using nested function calls, though it is much uglier: seqvec &lt;- 1:4 rep(rep(seqvec, each = 2), times = 3) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4.4 Vectorised operations Most simple operators (e.g. + and -) and many functions in R are vectorised. All this means is that when you use a vectorised operator / function it operates on vectors on an element-by-element basis. Take a look at this example to see what we mean by this: x &lt;- 1:10 x ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 y &lt;- seq(0.1, 1, length = 10) y ## [1] 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 x + y ## [1] 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9 11.0 We constructed two numeric variables with a length of 10, x and y, where x is a sequence from 1 to 10 and y is a sequence from 0.1 to 1. When R evaluates the expression x + y it does this by adding the first element of x to the first element of y, the second element of x to the second element of y, and so on, working through all 10 elements of x and y. This may seem like the “obvious” thing to do, but most computer languages do not work like this. Instead we have to write a much more complicated expression to do something so simple. This is one of the reasons R is such a data analysis language: vectorisation allows us to express repetitious calculations in a simple, intuitive way. Vectorisation is also implemented in the standard mathematical functions. For example, our friend the round function will round each element of vector: mynums &lt;- seq(0, 1, length = 13) mynums ## [1] 0.00000000 0.08333333 0.16666667 0.25000000 0.33333333 0.41666667 ## [7] 0.50000000 0.58333333 0.66666667 0.75000000 0.83333333 0.91666667 ## [13] 1.00000000 round(mynums, digits = 2) ## [1] 0.00 0.08 0.17 0.25 0.33 0.42 0.50 0.58 0.67 0.75 0.83 0.92 1.00 The same behaviour is seen with other mathematical functions like sin, cos, exp, and log. Each of these will apply the relevant function to each element of a numeric vector. Not all functions are vectorised though. For example, the sum function takes a vector of numbers and adds them up: sum(mynums) ## [1] 6.5 Although sum obviously works on a numeric vector it is not “vectorised” in the sense that it works element-by-element to return an output vector of the same length as its main argument. Many functions apply the vectorisation principle to more than one argument. Take a look at this example to see what we mean by this: mynums &lt;- rep(2/7, times = 6) round(mynums, digits = 1:6) ## [1] 0.300000 0.290000 0.286000 0.285700 0.285710 0.285714 We constructed a length 6 vector containing the number 2/7 – which equals approximately 0.285714 – and then used the round function to round each element to a different number of decimal places. The first element was rounded to 1 decimal place, the second to two decimal places, and so on. We get this behaviour because instead of using a single number for the digits argument, we used a vector that is an integer sequence from 1 to 6. This behaviour can save us a lot of time. It allows us to express a repetitious calculation in a single step while also varying the details of the calculation on an element-by-element basis. However, keep in mind that not every function treats its arguments in a vectorised way, so you need to check (most easily, by experimenting) whether this behaviour is available before relying on it. 4.5 Extracting subsets of vectors Extracting subsets of data is a very common task. Luckily for us, R is very good at doing this. In this last section we are going to see how to extract subsets of vectors. Actually, we are going to see how to extract subsets of atomic vectors, but that detail is not too crucial at this point. By the way, we use the word “subset” as a verb that is shorthand for “extract a subset of elements”. There are several ways to subset a vector. However, these always use a pair opening and closing square brackets, [ and ]. These should always be used together. Remember that we said a vector is a 1-dimensional object that contains an ordered collection of data objects that can be accessed by their position? This means we can use the [ construct with a numeric vector of integer(s) to subset the elements of vector by their position. Take a look at this example: cvec &lt;- c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) cvec[1] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; The cvec variable is a length 3 character vector, with elements corresponding to his first, middle and last name. In order to subset it an retain only the first element – his first name – we used the [ ] construct with the number 1 inside, placing [1] next to the name of the vector. Notice that we do not place a space anywhere in this construct. We could, but this is not conventional. Remember, “the number 1” is in fact a numeric vector of length 1. This suggest we might be able to use longer vectors to extract more than one element: cvec &lt;- c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) nindex &lt;- c(1, 3) cvec[nindex] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; We first constructed a numeric vector of length 2 called index, which has elements 1 and 3. We then used this to extract his first and last name by placing the its name inside the []. We did not have to do this in two steps though. This achieves the same result: cvec[c(1, 3)] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; You may have noticed something important. When we subset a vector of a particular type, we get a vector of the same type back, e.g. subsetting a character vector produces a character vector. We can also subset a vector by removing its elements if we need to. We use the - operator to do this. Here is an example that produces the same result as the last example, but in a different way: cvec[-2] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; Hopefully you can see why this works. The cvec[-2] construct indicates that we want all the elements of cvec except that at position 2. If we want to remove more than one element we just use a longer numeric vector inside the [ ]. For example, this leaves just his first name in the resulting character vector: cvec[-c(2, 3)] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; "],
["other-kinds-of-vectors.html", "Chapter 5 Other kinds of vectors 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Extracting subsets of vectors", " Chapter 5 Other kinds of vectors 5.1 Introduction We tend to use numeric vectors a lot. After all, the data we collect are often in the form of numbers, or they can at least be reduced to numerical summaries for further analysis. Sometimes however, we need to be able to represent other kinds of data. This chapter introduces two other types of atomic vector to help us do this: character vectors and logical vectors. 5.1.1 Character vectors The elements of character vectors are what are known as “character strings”, or just “strings” if we are feeling lazy. The phrase “character string” is just computer-speak for a sequence of characters. When we want to make a character vector in R we need to use double or single quotation marks around the string(s). Here is how we can print the name “Dylan” to the Console: &quot;Dylan&quot; ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; Notice the [1]. This shows that what we just printed is indeed an atomic vector of some kind. We also know it is a character vector because the output is printed with double quotes around the value. The quoting here is important. If we try to do the same thing without the quotes we generate an error: Dylan ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;Dylan&#39; not found The reason for this should be clear if you have been following our discussions about R evaluates expressions. When the interpreter sees the word Dylan without quotes it assumes that this must be the name of a variable, so it goes in search of it in the global environment. We haven’t made a variable called Dylan, so there is no way to evaluate the expression. We often need to make simple character vectors with only one value (i.e. vectors of length 1)—usually to set the values of arguments to a function. However, we can make longer character vectors using the c function if we need to: c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; Here we made a length 3 character vector, with elements corresponding to a first name, a middle name, and a last name. Take note, this is not the same as : c(&quot;Dylan Zachary Childs&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Dylan Zachary Childs&quot; The only element of this character vector is a single string that contains the first, middle and last name separated by a spaces. We didn’t need to use the the c function here because we were only ever working with a character vector of length 1. We just used only for consistency, i.e. we could have typed &quot;Dylan Zachary Childs&quot; and we would have ended up with exactly the same text printed at the Console. In addition to using the c function, we can construct repeating character vectors with rep. This works on character vectors in exactly the same way as it does on numeric vectors: cvec &lt;- c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) rep(cvec, each = 2, times = 3) ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; &quot;Dylan&quot; ## [8] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Dylan&quot; ## [15] &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Zachary&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; Each element was replicated twice (each = 2), and then the whole vector was replicated three times (times = 3), end to end. What about the seq function? Hopefully it is fairly obvious that we cannot use this function to construct character vectors. The seq function is designed to make sequences of numbers, from a starting value, to another. The notion of a sequence of character strings – for example, from &quot;Dylan&quot; to &quot;Childs&quot; – is meaningless. 5.1.2 Logical vectors The elements of logical vectors only take two values: TRUE or FALSE. These are called logical values. Do not let the simplicity of logical vectors fool you though: they are very useful. As with other kinds of vectors we can use the c function to construct short logical vectors and the rep function to construct repeating sequences of logical values: lvec &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) rep(lvec, times = 2) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE Nothing about this should surprise you by this point. So why are logical vectors useful? Their main purpose is to allow us to represent the results of questions such as, “is x greater than y”. This may not sound particularly useful, but at the end of this topic we will see how such questions can implemented via logical vectors in order to extract subsets of data. Let’s first look at how we use logical vectors to evaluate these kinds of questions. Before we can do that though we need to introduce relational operators. These sound fancy, but they are very simple: we use relational operators to evaluate the relative value of vector elements. Six are available in R: x &lt; y: is x less than y? x &gt; y: is x greater than y? x &lt;= y: is x less than or equal to y? x &gt;= y: is x greater than or equal to y? x == y: is x equal to y? x != y: is x not equal to y? The easiest way to understand how these work is just use them. We most often use relational operators with numeric vectors, so let’s make a couple of numeric variables to illustrate their use: x &lt;- 11:20 y &lt;- seq(3, 30, by = 3) x ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 y ## [1] 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 Now, if we need to evaluate and represent a question like, “is x greater than y”, we can use either &lt; or &gt;: x &lt; y ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE y &gt; x ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE These are both equivalent as long as we get the order of the x and y vectors right in each case. What do you notice about this simple example? Not surprisingly, it produces a logical vector, with TRUE values associated with elements in x are less than y, and FALSE otherwise. In this example, x is less than y until we reach the value of 15 in each sequence. Notice that this shows that relational operators are vectorised: the work on an element by element basis. They would be much less useful if this were not true. What does the == operator do? You can probably guess: it compares the elements of two vectors to determine if they are exactly equal: x == y ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE The output of this comparison is true only for one element, the number 15, which is at the 5th position in both x and y. Most of the other relational operators are self-explanatory so we will not illustrate their use. If you are in any doubt about how they work though experiment using the x and y above with them. = and == are not the same If you want to test for equivalence between the elements of two vectors you must use double equals, ==. If you forget this and use a single equals, =, you will run into problems. This is because the = symbol already has a use in R – assigning name-value pairs – so using it to compare vectors would lead to ambiguity in our R scripts. Forgetting this and using = when you meant to use == is a very common mistake. If you make it, this mistake will lead to all kinds of difficult-to-comprehend problems with your scripts. Try not to do it. 5.2 Extracting subsets of vectors Extracting subsets of data is a very common task. Luckily for us, R is very good at doing this. In this last section we are going to see how to extract subsets of vectors. Actually, we are going to see how to extract subsets of atomic vectors, but that detail is not too crucial at this point. By the way, we use the word “subset” as a verb that is shorthand for “extract a subset of elements”. There are several ways to subset a vector. However, these always use a pair opening and closing square brackets, [ and ]. These should always be used together. Remember that we said a vector is a 1-dimensional object that contains an ordered collection of data objects that can be accessed by their position? This means we can use the [ construct with a numeric vector of integer(s) to subset the elements of vector by their position. Take a look at this example: cvec &lt;- c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) cvec[1] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; The cvec variable is a length 3 character vector, with elements corresponding to his first, middle and last name. In order to subset it an retain only the first element – his first name – we used the [ ] construct with the number 1 inside, placing [1] next to the name of the vector. Notice that we do not place a space anywhere in this construct. We could, but this is not conventional. Remember, “the number 1” is in fact a numeric vector of length 1. This suggest we might be able to use longer vectors to extract more than one element: cvec &lt;- c(&quot;Dylan&quot;, &quot;Zachary&quot;, &quot;Childs&quot;) nindex &lt;- c(1, 3) cvec[nindex] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; We first constructed a numeric vector of length 2 called index, which has elements 1 and 3. We then used this to extract his first and last name by placing the its name inside the []. We did not have to do this in two steps though. This achieves the same result: cvec[c(1, 3)] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; You may have noticed something important. When we subset a vector of a particular type, we get a vector of the same type back, e.g. subsetting a character vector produces a character vector. We can also subset a vector by removing its elements if we need to. We use the - operator to do this. Here is an example that produces the same result as the last example, but in a different way: cvec[-2] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; Hopefully you can see why this works. The cvec[-2] construct indicates that we want all the elements of cvec except that at position 2. If we want to remove more than one element we just use a longer numeric vector inside the [ ]. For example, this leaves just his first name in the resulting character vector: cvec[-c(2, 3)] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; A second way to subset a vector makes use of logical vectors inside the [ ]. This is usually done using two vectors of the same length: the focal vector we wish to subset, and a logical vector that specifies which elements to keep. Here is a very simple example: lindex &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) cvec[lindex] ## [1] &quot;Dylan&quot; &quot;Childs&quot; This should be fairly self-explanatory. The logical vector method of subsetting works element-by-element. An element in cvec is retained wherever the corresponding element in lindex contains a TRUE, otherwise it is discarded. Why is this useful? After all, using a integer vector of positions to subset a vector is much more direct. The reason is that we can use relational operators to help us select elements according to particular criteria. This is best illustrated with an example. We will start by defining two vectors of the same length: name &lt;- c(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;wren&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;) name ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;wren&quot; &quot;pig&quot; &quot;owl&quot; type &lt;- c(&quot;mammal&quot;, &quot;mammal&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;mammal&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;) type ## [1] &quot;mammal&quot; &quot;mammal&quot; &quot;bird&quot; &quot;mammal&quot; &quot;bird&quot; The first, name, is a character vector containing the common names of a few animals. The second, type, is another character vector whose elements denote the type of animal, in this case, a bird or a mammal. The vectors are arranged such that the information is associated via the position of elements in each vector. Let’s assume that we want to create a subset of name that only contains the names of mammals. We can do this by creating a logical vector from type, where the values are TRUE if an element is equal to &quot;mammal&quot; and FALSE otherwise. We know how to do this using the == operator: lindex &lt;- type == &quot;mammal&quot; lindex ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE We stored the result in a variable called lindex. Now all we need to do is use with lindex inside the [ ] construct to subset name: name[lindex] ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;pig&quot; We have done this the long way so that you can understand the logic of how subsetting vectors with logical operators. This is quite verbose, so we would usually combine the two steps into a single R expression: name[type == &quot;mammal&quot;] ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;pig&quot; We can use all of the relational operators like this. If we define a numeric variable that contains the mean mass (in grams) of each animal, we can use this to subset names according to the associated mean mass. For example, if we want a subset that contains only those animals where the mean mass is greater than 1kg we use: mass &lt;- c(2900, 9000, 10, 18000, 2000) name[mass &gt; 1000] ## [1] &quot;cat&quot; &quot;dog&quot; &quot;pig&quot; &quot;owl&quot; Just remember, this way of using information in one vector to create subsets of a second vector only works if the information in each is associated via the position of their respective elements. Keeping a bunch of different vectors organised like this is difficult and error prone. In the next block we’ll learn how to use something called a data frame and the dplyr package to make working with a collection of related vectors much easier. "],

This system is orientated around the base R functions and packages. Every good package comes with a set of help files. At a minimum these should provide information about the individual package functions and summaries of the data included with the package. They sometimes give descriptions of how different parts of the package should be used, and if we’re lucky, one or more “vignettes” that offer a practical demonstration of how to use a package. Other files are sometimes shipped with packages. For example, these might give an overview of the mathematical or computational theory a package relies on. We will not worry about these in this course. We may as well get something out of the way early on. The word “help” in the phrase “help file” is a bit of a misnomer. It is probably more accurate to say R has an extensive documentation system. The reason we say this is that the majority help files are associated with functions, and these kinds of files are designed first and foremost to document how a particular function or group of functions are meant to be used. For example, they describe what kinds of arguments a function can take and what kind of objects it will return to us. Help files are also written in a very precise, painful-to-read manner. They contain a lot of jargon which can be hard to decipher unless you already know a lot about R or you have a computer science background. The take-home message is that R help files are aimed more at experienced users than novices. Their primary purpose is to carefully document the different elements of a package, rather than explain how a particular function or the package as whole should be used to achieve a given end. That said, help files often contain useful examples, and many package authors do try to make our life easier by providing functional demonstrations of their package (those “vignettes” we mentioned above are a vehicle for doing this). It is very important to try to get to grips with the built in help system. It contains a great deal of useful information which you need to learn how to decipher in order to start using R effectively. The road to enlightenment is bumpy though. 6.2 Browsing the help system How do we access the help system? Help files are a little like mini web pages, which means we can navigate among them using hyperlinks. This makes it very easy to explore the help system. One way to begin browsing the help system uses the help.start function: help.start() If you type this now at the Console you will see the Package Index page open up in the Help tab of the bottom right pane in RStudio. This lists all the packages currently installed on your computer. We can view all the help files associated with a package by clicking on the appropriate link. For example, the functions that come with the base installation of R have a help file associated with them – click on the link to the R base package (base) to see these. Though you know about a few of these already, you will see a lot of functions listed here. R is huge. The packages that come with the base R installation and those that we install separately from base R have their own set of associated help files. These can be viewed by following the appropriate link on the Package Index page. We will learn how to navigate these in a moment. Take note: it is up to the developer of a package to produce usable help files. Well-designed packages like dplyr and ggplot2 have an extensive help system that covers almost everything the package can do. This isn’t always the the case though, particularly with new or packages or packages that are not widely used. We will only ever use well-documented packages. Notice that the help browser has Forward, Back, and Home buttons, just like a normal web browser. If you get lost in the mire of help pages you can always navigate backward until you get back to a familiar page. Annoyingly, the Home button does not take you to the same page as help.start. Click the home button now if you have not already done so. You will see three sections: The Manuals section looks like it might be useful for novice users. Unfortunately, it is not. Even the “Introduction to R” manual is only helpful if you already have some programming experience, since it assumes you understand what terms like “data structure” and “data type” mean. It is worth reading this manual once you have gained a little more experience though. The others manuals. are more or less impenetrable unless you already know quite a bit about computing in general. The Reference section is a little more helpful. The “Packages” link just takes you to the same page opened by help.start so that you can browse help pages on a package-specific basis. The “Search Engine &amp; Keywords” link takes you to a search engine page (no surprises there). You can use this to search for specific help pages, either by supplying a search term or by navigating through the different keywords. We will discuss the built-in search engine in the next subsection. The Miscellaneous Material section has a couple of potentially useful links. The “User Manuals” link lists any user manuals supplied by package authors. These tend to be aimed at more experienced users and the packages we will learn to use in this course do not provide them. However, it is worth knowing these exist as they are occasionally useful. The “Frequently Asked Questions” link is worth reviewing once you have gained a little experience of R, but again, most of the FAQs are a little difficult for novice users to fully understand. 6.3 Searching for help files If you spend a short amount of time browsing help files via help.start it will quickly become obvious that this way of searching for help is not very efficient. Quite often we know the name of the function we need to use and all we want to do is open its associated help file. We do this using the help function: help(topic = Trig) If you run this simple example you should see RStudio open up the help file for the trigonometry topic in the Help tab. This provides information about the various trigonometric functions such as sin or cos. We will learn how to make sense of help pages in the next subsection. For now we just need to understand how to use help. The help function needs a minimum of one argument: the name of the topic or function of interest. When we use it like this the help function searches across packages, looking for a help file whose name gives an exact match to the name we supplied. In this case, we opened the help file associated with the Trig topic. Most of the time we use the help function to find the help page for a specific function, rather than a general topic. This is fine if you can remember the name of the topic associated with different functions. Most of us cannot. Luckily, the help function will also match help pages by the name of the function(s) they cover: help(topic = sin) Here we searched for help on the sin function. This is part of the Trig topic so help(topic = sin) brings up the same page as the help(topic = Trig). There are several arguments of help that we can set to alter its behaviour. We will just consider one of these. By default, the help function only searches for files associated with the base functions or with packages that we have loaded in the current session with the library function. If you wanted to search for help on the mutate function – which is part of the dplyr package – but you haven’t run library(dplyr) yet this will not work: help(mutate) ## Help on topic &#39;mutate&#39; was found in the following packages: ## ## Package Library ## plyr /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library ## dplyr /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library ## ## ## Using the first match ... Instead, you need tell help where to look by setting the package argument: help(mutate, package = dplyr) You should try to start using help every time you get stuck because you cannot get a function to work. It doesn’t matter how experienced an R user you become, you will occasionally forget how to use the odd function. It is for this reason that R has a built in shortcut for help. This is accessed via ?. For example, instead of typing help(topic = sin) (or just help(sin)) at the Console, we can bring up the help page for the sin function by using ? like this: ?sin This is just a convenient shortcut that does the same thing as help. The only difference is that ? does not allow us to set arguments such as package. 6.4 Navigating help files Navigating a typical help file is a little daunting at first. These files can be quite long and they contain a lot of jargon. The help files associated with functions – the most common type – have a consistent structure though. There are a number of distinct sections, whose order is always the same. Wrestling with a help file is much easier if you are at least clear about the purpose of each section. After the title, there are eight of these you need to know about: Description gives us a short overview of what the function is meant to be used for. If the help page covers a family of related functions it gives a collective overview of all the functions. You should always read this before diving into the rest of the help file. Usage shows how the function(s) are meant to be used. It lists each member of the family as well as their common arguments. The argument names are listed on their own if they have no default, or in name-value pairs, where the value gives the default used should we choose not to set it ourselves when we call the function. Arguments lists each of the allowed arguments, along with a short description of what they influence. This also tells us what what kind of data we are allowed to use with each argument, along with the allowable values (if this is relevant). You should always read this section. Details describes precisely how the function(s) behave, often in painful, jargon-laden detail. It is usually the longest and hardest-to-comprehend section but is worth reading as it flags up common “gotchas”. You can sometimes get away with ignoring this section if the previous three are informative enough, but if you really want to understand a function you need to wade through this. Value explains kind of data structure or object a function returns to us when it finishes doing whatever it does. You can often guess what this will be from the type of function, but it is worth checking to see if your reasoning is correct. If it is not, you probably don’t understand the function yet. References just lists the key reference(s) you should read if you really need to know the hows and whys of a function. You almost never need to read this. The one exception is if the function implements a particular statistical tool. In that case it might be sensible to go away and read the literature before trying to use it. See Also gives links to the help pages of related functions. These are usually functions that do something similar to the function of interest or are meant to be used in conjunction with it. You can often learn quite a bit about packages or related functions by following the links in this section. Examples provides one or more examples of how to use the function. These are stand-alone examples, so there is nothing to stop you running them. This is often the most useful section of all. Seeing a function in action is a very good way to cut through the jargon and start to understand how it works. 6.5 Vignettes and demos The Oxford English Dictionary defines a vignette as, “A brief evocative description, account, or episode.” The purpose of a package vignette in R is to provide a relatively brief, practical account of one or more of its features. Not all packages come with vignettes, though many of the best thought out packages do. You can use the vignette function to view all the available vignettes in Rstudio. This will open up a tab that lists each vignette under their associated package name along with a brief description. A package will often have more than one vignette. If you just want to see the vignettes associated with a particular package, you should set the package argument. For example, to see the vignettes associated with dplyr you would use: vignette(package = &quot;dplyr&quot;) Each vignette has a name (the “topic”) and is available either as a PDF or HTML file (or both). We can view a particular vignette by passing the vignette function the package and topic arguments. For example, to view the “data_frames” vignette in the dplyr package we would use: vignette(topic = &quot;data_frames&quot;, package = &quot;dplyr&quot;) The vignette function is fine, though it is usually more convenient to browse the list of vignettes inside a web browser. This allows you to open a particular vignette directly by clicking on its link, rather than working at the Console. We can use the browseVignettes function to do this: browseVignettes() This will open a page in your browser showing the vignettes you can view. As you might expect by now, you can narrow your options to a specific package by setting the package argument. In addition to vignettes, some packages also include one or more demos (i.e. demonstrations). Demos are a little like vignettes, but instead of just opening a file for you to read, the demo function can actually runs a demonstration R scripts for you. We use the demo function without any arguments to list the available demos: demo() When we use the demo function like this it only lists the demos associated with packages that have been loaded in the current session (via library). If we want to see all the demos you can run you need to use the somewhat cryptic demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)). In order to actually run a demo we use the demo function, setting the topic and package arguments. For example, to run the “colors” demo in the grDevices package we would use: ## ## ## demo(colors) ## ---- ~~~~~~ ## ## &gt; ### ----------- Show (almost) all named colors --------------------- ## &gt; ## &gt; ## 1) with traditional &#39;graphics&#39; package: ## &gt; showCols1 &lt;- function(bg = &quot;gray&quot;, cex = 0.75, srt = 30) { ## + m &lt;- ceiling(sqrt(n &lt;- length(cl &lt;- colors()))) ## + length(cl) &lt;- m*m;

["packages.html", "Chapter 7 Packages 7.1 The R package system 7.2 Task views 7.3 Using packages", " Chapter 7 Packages 7.1 The R package system The R package system is probably the most important single factor driving increased adoption of R among quantitatively-minded scientists. Packages make it very easy to extend the basic capabilities of R. In his book about R packages Hadley Wickam says, Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. An R package is just a collection of folders and files in a standard, well-defined format. They bundle together together computer code, data, and documentation in a way that is easy to use and share with other users. The computer code might all be R code, but it can also include code written in other languages. Packages provide an R-friendly interface to use this “foreign” code without the need to understand how it works. When you download the base R distribution it comes with quiet a few packages already installed. These are “mature” packages that implement widely used statistical and plotting functionality. These base R packages represent a very small subset of all the packages you can use with R though. The majority of packages are hosted on a network of web servers around the world collectively know as CRAN. This network – which is known as a repository – is the same one we used to download the base R distribution in the Get up and running with R and RStudio chapter. CRAN stands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network, pronounced either “see-ran” or “kran”. CRAN is a fairly spartan web site, so it is easy to find your way around. If you now navigate to CRAN you will see about a dozen links of the right hand side of the page. Under the Software section there is link called Packages. Near the top of this page there is a link called Table of available packages, sorted by name. Following this link takes you to a very long list of all the packages hosted on CRAN – the column on the left shows each package name, followed by a brief description of what the package does on the right. There are a huge number of packages here (6369 at the time of writing). It is worth spending a few minutes looking over this list to get a sense of the diversity of R packages. 7.2 Task views A big list of packages presented like this is overwhelming. Unless you already know the name of the package you want to investigate it is very hard to find anything useful this way. A more user-friendly view of many R packages can be found on the Task Views page. The link to this is on the left hand side, under the section labelled CRAN. If you navigate to the Task Views page now you will see of list of topics with a brief description. A Task View is basically a curated guide to the packages and functions that are useful for certain disciplines. The Environmentrics Task View maintained by Gavin Simpson contains information about using R to analyse ecological and environmental data. It is not surprising this Task View exists. Ecologists and environmental scientists are among the most enthusiastic R users. This view is a good place to start if you find yourself in need of a package to support a particular analysis in a future project. The Experimental Design, Graphics, Multivariate, Phylogenetics, Spatial, Survival and Time Series Task Views alll contain some useful information for biologists and environmental scientists. 7.3 Using packages Two things need to happen in order for you to use a package. First, you need to ensure that a copy of the folders and files that comprise the package are copied to an appropriate folder on your computer, called a library. This is called installing the package. Second, we need to load and attach the package for use in a particular R session. As usual, the word “session” in this context just refers to the time between when you start up R and close it down again. Let’s unpack what we just said, because for some reason the package system often confuses new users. If you do not have a copy of a package’s folders and files in the right format and in the right place on your computer you cannot use it. This is probably fairly obvious to you. The process of making this copy is called installing the package. We could install a package by going to the CRAN website, downloading the package and making use of various tools in R to install it. We will not use this approach because it is inefficient and error prone. Instead, we will use built-in R functions to grab the package from CRAN and install it for us, all in one step. You do not need to install the packages you plan to use every time you start a new R session. It is worth saying that again, there is no need to install packages each time you open up R / RStudio. Once you have a copy of the package on your hard drive it will remain there for you to use, unless you delete it or you install a version of R. Installing a package does nothing more than place a copy of the relevant files on your hard drive. If you want to use the functions or data that come with a package you need to make them available in your current R session. Unlike package installation this process has to be repeated every time you restart R. Take note: every time you install a new major version of R (not RStudio) you will need to reinstall any packages you plan to use. This is because the R installer will not copy installed packages to the new version of R. 7.3.1 Viewing installed packages We sometimes need to check whether a package is currently installed on our computer. Use the find.package function to do this: find.package(&quot;MASS&quot;) ## [1] &quot;/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library/MASS&quot; This prints a file path showing where the package is located, or returns an error if the package does not exist. If you understand file paths, great. If you do not, then the take home message is that find.package will only return some location information if a package has been installed. The is also a function called installed.packages that returns something called a data frame object (these are discussed in the next block) containing a lot of information about the packages installed on your computer. As you might expect, RStudio provides a more intuitive way to see which packages are installed on your computer. The Packages tab in the top right pane of RStudio shows the name of every installed package, a brief description (the same one seen on CRAN) and a version number. We can also manage our packages from this tab, as we are about to find out. 7.3.2 Installing and updating packages R packages can be installed in a number of different ways. For example, they can be installed from a local file on your computer, from the CRAN repository, or from a different kind of online repository called Github. Although CRAN alternatives are becoming more popular, in this course we will only worry about installing packages that live on CRAN. In order to install a package from an online repository like CRAN we have to first download the package files, possibly uncompress them (like you would a ZIP file), and move them to the correct location. Fortunately, all of this can be done at the Console using a single function, install.packages. For example, if we want to install the fortunes package, we use: install.packages(&quot;fortunes&quot;) The quotes are necessary by the way. Try this on your own computer. If everything is working – e.g. you have an active internet connection, you used a valid package name, and so on – R will briefly pause while it communicates with the CRAN servers, you should see some red text and then you will be returned to the prompt. The red text is just letting us know what R is up to. As long as this text does not include an error, there is no need to worry about it. There is nothing to stop us using install.packages to install more than one package at a time. We are going to use dplyr and ggplot2 in the next two blocks. Since neither of these is part of the base R distribution, we need to download and install them from CRAN. Here is one way to do this: pckg.names &lt;- c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(pckg.names) Simple. If you are working on your own computer you should do this now so that they are ready to use later in the course. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you install packages. First, package names are case sensitive, like variable names. For example, fortunes is not the same as Fortunes. Quite often when you fail to install a package which you know exists it is because you used the wrong case somewhere in its name. The other aspect of packages you keep to know about is related to dependencies: some packages rely on other packages in order to work properly. By default install.packages will install these dependencies for us, so we do not usually have to worry too much about them. However, do not be surprised if using the install.packages function installs more than one package when you only specified one package name. If you prefer not to work at the Console to install packages RStudio gives you a way of interacting with install.packages via the GUI. The Packages tab has an “Install”&quot; button at the top right. Clicking on this brings up a small window with three main fields: “Install from”, “Packages”, and “Install to Library”. We only need to work with the “Packages” field – the other two can be left at their defaults. When you start typing in the first few letters of a package name (e.g. dplyr) RStudio will provide a list of available packages that match this. After we select the one we want and click the “Install” button RStudio invokes install.packages with the appropriate arguments at the Console for us. 7.3.3 Loading and attaching packages Once we have installed a package or two we will probably want to actually use them. Two things have to happen to access a package’s facilities: the package has to be loaded into memory, and then it has to attached to something called a search path so that R can find it. It is beyond the scope of the course to get in to hows and whys of this. Luckily for us loading and attaching a package is done with a single function called library, so there is no need to worry about the details. Library works exactly as you would expect it to. If we want to start using the fortunes package – which we just installed above – all we need is: library(fortunes) Notice that library does not need its main argument to be quoted; library(&quot;fortunes&quot;) does the same thing though. Nothing much happens if everything is working as it should. R just returns us to the prompt without printing anything to the Console. The difference is that now we can use the functions that fortunes provides. As it turns out, there is only one: fortune() ## ## Friends don&#39;t let friends use Excel for statistics! ## -- Jonathan D. Cryer (about problems with using Microsoft Excel for ## statistics) ## JSM 2001, Atlanta (August 2001) The fortunes package is either very useful or utterly pointless, depending on your perspective. It dispenses quotes from various R experts delivered through the R mailing list over the years. As usual, if you really do not like using the command line RStudio can help you out. There is a small button next to each package listed in the Packages tab. Packages that have been loaded and attached have a blue check box next to them, whereas this is absent from those that have not. Clicking on an empty check box will load up the package. Try this. Notice that all it does is invoke library with the appropriate arguments for us (RStudio explicitly sets the lib.loc argument, whereas above we just relied on the default value). Never use install.packages in scripts Because installing a package is a “do once” operation, it is almost never a good idea to place install.packages in a typical R script. A script may be run 100s of times as we develop an analysis. Installing a package is quite time consuming, so we don’t really want to do it every time we run our analysis. As long as the package has been installed at some point in the past it is ready to be used and the script will work fine without reinstalling it. On the other hand, if a script makes use of a package we do need to load and attach that package before we can use it, i.e. loading and attaching a package is a “do every time” operation. This means that it is a good idea to include library in a script that needs to use a package. We can use library anywhere, but typically the library(&lt;package name&gt;) expressions live at the very beginning of a script so that everything is ready to use later on. 7.3.4 An analogy We noted above that the package system often confuses new users. The reason for this stems from the fact that they aren’t really clear about what the install.packages and library functions are doing. One way to think about these is by analogy with smartphone “Apps”. Think of an R package as being analogous to a smartphone App— a package effectively extends what R can do, just as an App extends what your phone can do. When you want to try out a new App you have to first download it from an App store and install it on your phone. Once it has been downloaded, an App lives permanently on your phone (unless you delete it!) and can be used whenever you need it. Downloading and installing an App is something you only have to do once. Packages are no different. When you want to use an R package you also have to make sure it is first installed on your computer. This is effectively what install.packages does: it grabs the package from CRAN (the “App store”) and installs it on your computer. Installing a package is a “do once” operation. Once you have installed it, you don’t need to install a package again each time you restart R. The package is sat on your hard drive ready to be used. (There are obvious exceptions to the “do once” rule. If you have recently updated R you will need to reinstall all the packages you need to use. This is a bit like buying a new phone. Similarly, you may need to occasionally reinstall a package to get hold of a latest version.) In order to actually use an App which has been installed on your phone you have to open it up by tapping on its icon. You obviously have to do this every time you want to use the App. The package equivalent of opening a smartphone App is the load and attach operation. This is what library does. It makes a package available for use in a particular session. You have to use library to load the package every time you start a new R session if you plan to access the functions in that package. So loading and attaching a package via library is a “do every time” operation. "],
["stuff.html", "Chapter 8 Stuff… 8.1 Mathematical functions in R 8.2 Coding conventions 8.3 Beyond vectors", " Chapter 8 Stuff… Values and objects We’ve been using the word “value” to describe the result of a calculation. That word is entirely sensible when thinking about In R-land, the word “object” just means “a thing R knows how to represent”. R objects can be stored and reused. They can as simple as a set of one or more numbers, or a more complicated construct like a statistical model or a graphical description of some data. 8.1 Mathematical functions in R Many R functions behave in a very similar way to the mathematical functions you may have studied at secondary school. They take one or inputs (the arguments) and then map these to a unique output. Indeed, most familiar mathematical functions are available in R. These can all be used with a single argument, named x. Try the following to gain a sense of how to use them: There is very often more than one way to achieve the same result in R. See if you can find the solutions to a quadratic equation again (last topic) using R, but this time write the two required R expressions using the sqrt function. Which version do you find easier to read? Compare the behaviour of sin and sinpi. Hints: (1) R always follows scientific convention, which means angles are measured in radians. One full rotation of a circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians. (2) The mathematical constant \\(\\pi\\) is available in r – called pi. See if you can work out why we seem to have two very similar functions by comparing the results for a half-rotation. If you did not study maths past the age of 16 the second exercise might be a little tricky, so skip it if you don’t feel like Googling some trigonometry. 8.2 Coding conventions Although they often allow a great deal of flexibily in the way things are named, most computer languages have a well-defined set of cenventions for names. Unfortunately, R is not one of them. The R community never managed to agree on a set of conventions for how we should name things, and the R ecosystem so large that it’s probably too late for this to ever happen. This doesn’t 8.2.1 Formatting functions Since we are starting to use functions, now is a good time to think about basic formatting issues. Take another look at the way we wrote out round(x = 3.141593, digits = 2). There are a few conventions demonstrated here that you should really try to adopt: 1) although it is perfectly valid to place a space between the function name and the parentheses – R will be able to interpret your code – this makes your code harder to read, so leave out the space; 2) remember to place a space after, but not before, each comma when writing out a series of arguments; 3) put a space either side of the = sign when writing out the name-value pairs. This may seem like nit-picking, but trust us, if you adopt these conventions you will make fewer mistakes and spend less time trying to write error-free scripts. 8.3 Beyond vectors A data structure is just a particular way of organising data (e.g. numbers) on your computer, so that it can be accessed easily and efficiently. Computer languages use many different kinds of data structures, about which long and tedious books have been written. Luckily, we only need to learn about a few to use R for data analysis, and in this course only two kinds of data structure really matter. It is worth briefly reviewing the common R data structures though, in case you end up reading about them at some point. (Atomic) Vectors: A vector is a “1-dimensional” object that contains an ordered collection of data objects that can be accessed by their position: position 1, position 2, position 3, and so one. When people talk about “vectors”&quot; in R they are often actually referring to Atomic Vectors. These are the simplest kind of data structure in R. They are just vectors that can only contain data of one type, for example, all integers (e.g. 2, 4, 6, …) or all characters (e.g. “A”, “B”, “C”). They are called “atomic” for the simple reason that they can’t be broken down into anything simpler. Matrices and Arrays: A matrix is essentially a 2-dimensional version of a vector. They are table-like data structures where the data is accessed via a row position and column position: row 1, column 1; row 1, column 2; row 2, column 1, and so on. Matrices crop up a lot in statistics and mathematics, so it is not surprising that they are supported in R. Arrays are a further generalisation of vectors to more than two dimensions. Lists: You can think of these as another generalisation of vectors. They are (usually) a 1-dimensional object that contains an ordered collection of data objects accessed by their position. However, they can contain virtually any kind of object R can construct. For example, a list might contain an atomic vectors at position 1, a matrix at position 2, another list at position 3, and even a function at position 4. Lists are really useful because they give us a way to keep a number of different kinds of objects together. Data frames: Data frames are a bit like a cross between a list and matrix. They are designed to store collections of related variables together so that we can use them with R’s plotting and statistical modelling facilities. As with matrices we can access the elements of of a data frame by referencing rows and column positions. They are list-like, because different types of data can be stored in separate columns. Don’t worry to much if those descriptions don’t make a whole lot of sense to you at the moment. We just want you to be aware of the main types of data structure you may run into in the future. In this course we only really care about vectors and data frames. The rest of this topic is concerned with vectors. We will deal with data frames in the next block when we start to discuss how to work with data in R. "]
